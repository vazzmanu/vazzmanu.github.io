								<section>

									<p>Over the next decade, the Artemis program will lay the foundation for a sustained long-term presence on the lunar surface and use the Moon to validate deep space systems and operations before embarking on the much farther voyage to Mars.</p>
									<p>The first human mission to Mars will mark a transformative moment for human civilization. Establishing a sustained lunar presence and taking the initial steps toward the first human mission to Mars will be one of the greatest feats of engineering and the greatest voyage of exploration and discovery in human history.</p>
									<p>Our return to the Moon begins with robots. NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has been imaging and mapping the Moon in preparation for a human return. By using the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) will deliver science and commercial payloads to the surface of the Moon. Nasa is commited to to use this approach to deliver its next robotic lunar rover, the Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER), which will conduct science investigations on the lunar volatiles at the MoonÂ´s South Pole. Using the CLPS they will demonstrate precision landing, starting with CLPS deliveries to build experience that will enhance all futre landings, human and robotic. Later the CLPS approach will be used to deliver other large cargo elements in direct support of human lunar missions.</p>
									<p>Landers and rovers provide excellent platforms to demonstrate technologies that will enable greater lunar surface mission capabilities and have applications that extend beyond Moon to Mars, such as terrestrial robotic mining systems and power storage.</p>
									<h3>Early Artemis missions</h3>
									<p>The Artemis program begins with an uncrewwed flight test of the SLS and Orion (Artemis I), then a crewed flight test (Artemis II). Artemis I wil see SLS send an uncrewed Orion 280,000 miles from Earth over the course of a 3 week mission. This mission will deploy CubeSats that will conduct new scientific investigations and new technology demonstrations.</p>
									<p>On Artemis II, astronauts will return to the proximities of the Moon and at the end of this mission, NASA intends to have tested every hardware, software, and operational component of Artemis III <b>except</b> for the actual landing on the surrface.</p>
									<p>Artemis III will be the culmination of the rigorous testing and nearly one million miles of flight demonstrations that NASA will accumulate during the Artemis I and II. Artemis III will land the first woman and next man on the Moon in 2024.</p>
									<h3>Artemis after 2024</h3>

									<p>Artemis Base Camp will be our first sustainable foothold on the lunar surface. The 3 principal mission elements of the Artemis Camp are:</p> 
									<ul>
										<li>The LTV that can transport crew around the site.</li>
										<li>The habitable mobile platform for long duration trips away from the Base Camp.</li>
										<li>The foundation surface habitat.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Combined with communications, power, radiation shield, waste disposal and storage planning making a sustained capability on the Moon that can be revisited and built upon over the coming decades.</p>
